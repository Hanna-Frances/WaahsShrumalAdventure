SATURDAY
Waah sighed as they went through the routine of getting up. “Has it been a week yet?” Waah muttered.
Waah glanced at their bottle of manure. It was almost empty! “What if I run out?” They thought worriedly.
Waah glanced at the obstacles that lined the stone path, almost screaming in frustration. How much longer would it be until Waah reached the end??
Waah walked along the path, climbing over rocks and balancing on logs. However, they did not get much sleep last night, and Waah fell off a log!
“Well, that’s normal,” Waah thought, but then a rock fell on them!
It thankfully was not a very large rock, but Waah was trapped underneath. 
Waah opened their mouth to call for the stone tablet, but it had already appeared!
“If you answer this math question correctly, I will take that rock off of you!” The stone tablet read.
Waah smiled. That stone tablet sure was helpful!
