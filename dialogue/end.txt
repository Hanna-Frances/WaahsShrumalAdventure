THANK YOU FOR PLAYING WAAH'S SHRUMAL ADVENTURE!
A huge thanks goes out to my younger sister Angela who wrote ALL the dialogue. 
I hope you got the ending you wanted, and if you read the long version I hope you enjoyed the novel that my sister accidentally created.
Initially I thought that this would be a small project but I realize now that its sorta larger than expected, so sorry sir!
GLHF!
