THURSDAY
When Waah woke up, they did not even feel like getting up. It would just be another day of walking, math and confused screaming.
Eventually, Waah remembered that they were there to become a member of the Holy Court of Mushrooms, and they somehow got the energy to drink a bit of manure.
Waah packed their blanket in their backpack and went on walking on the stone path. 
After a few hours, they spotted a multitude of bright blue lights hovering on the edge of the path. 
Fireflies! “Wow! Pretty!” Waah squealed, and sprinted off the path to look at them. 
In Mushroom culture, it was good luck to touch a blue firefly. Maybe if Waah touched one, Waah’s achiness would be cured!
As Waah got closer, though, the fireflies moved further away. Letting out a frustrated growl, Waah followed the fireflies through the bushes, making sure to keep them in sight.
The fireflies suddenly disappeared! “Oh no!” Waah cried as they realized that they could not see the path anymore. 
Stumbling in a random direction, Waah somehow managed to get themself stuck in some vines.
The sharp thorns pierced Waah whenever they twitched, and Waah began to regret their decision of following the fireflies.
The stone tablet appeared again! “If you answer this math question correctly, I will free you from the vines!” It read.
Waah tried to nod, but remembered that if they did, the thorns would poke them again. Instead Waah said, “okay.”
