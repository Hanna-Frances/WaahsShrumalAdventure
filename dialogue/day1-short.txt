MONDAY
Waah got some items from Mushy (a council member) before heading into the obstacle course. They got a map and a bottle of manure, along with a backpack. 
The obstacle course would last about one week long, and the things in it would make Waah use math. 
If Waah gets at least 3 calculations wrong, they wouldnâ€™t be allowed to join the Court of Holy Mushrooms! 
Waah headed into the course. They put the map and manure into the backpack. 
There is no paper in the backpack, so Waah would have to use mental math the whole time.
Right after Waah goes in, a tablet of stone appears in front of Waah. Waah has to solve the equation on it!
