WEDNESDAY
Waah woke up aching all over. They were not in very good physical condition, so naturally they would wake up with an aching body. 
Waah stumbled to their feet and tried to drink another few sips of manure, but the manure bottle was gone! Some sort of small bug had hid it in a tree! 
“Oh no!” Waah wailed. They were very hungry at the moment, and couldn’t even bear the thought of climbing a tree with their whole body hurting.
The stone tablet appeared again! “If you answer this math question correctly, I will take your manure down from the tree for you.” It read.
“Okay.” Waah decided.
