SUNDAY
Waah woke up and after less than an hour of walking, they saw that the stone path ended!
“Am - am I done?” Waah asked themself.
“Not quite,” a voice said from behind them, and Waah whirled around to see Shroom - the mushroom who had bought from the Manure Shop a week ago!
“What do you mean?” Waah asked, “and what are you doing here?”
“You must defeat the final boss,” Shroom said, “well, if you didn’t fail too many times.”
The stone tablet suddenly appeared out of nowhere, but Waah was used to it by now. 
“Waah - surprisingly - did not fail,” The tablet read, “so they are allowed to fight the final boss.”
“But what is the final boss?” Waah asked frustratedly.
Shroom and the stone tablet both stared at Waah. Well, if stone tablets had faces.
“Even a mushroomling would have figured it out by now!” Shroom hollered, “I am the final boss! The Radiant Shrumal Ogre!”
“WOT?” Waah gasped, “oh - but why are you not talking loudly?”
“Never mind that!” Radiant Shrumal Ogre snarled, “come fight me!”
“We must explain the rules first,” the stone tablet read, hovering between the two mushrooms. 
“There are fifteen stones in this pile,” the tablet explained, gesturing towards a small pile of stones that Waah had not seen before. 
“Each player will take turns taking 1, 2 or 3 stones from the pile. Whoever takes the last stone loses! Simple, right?”
“Uh - okay,” Waah said, “so who will go first?”
“You will,” the stone tablet read, and Radiant Shrumal Ogre glared at it. “Since when-”
“Let’s just start!” Waah cried. They wanted to become a member of the Court already!
“Okay,” Radiant Shrumal Ogre grumbled, and the two mushrooms went over to the pile of stones.
