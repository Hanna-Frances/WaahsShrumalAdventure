Waah got up and took a few sips of manure. The bottle was almost empty, and Waah worried that they would run out.
Waah walked along the path, climbing over the obstacles. However, when climbing over a log, Waah fell off!
A rock also fell on top of Waah, so they were trapped. Waah sighed, but couldn’t muster the energy to get up.
The stone tablet appeared! “If you answer this math question correctly, I will take that rock off of you!” It read.
Waah smiled. That stone tablet sure was helpful!
