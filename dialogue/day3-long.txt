WEDNESDAY
When Waah woke up, they were aching all over. Even before the obstacle course - well, for Waah’s whole life - Waah wasn’t a very athletic mushroom. 
Waah was the kind who only went out for food and work, binge watching shows and eating manure popcorn when they were not. 
Those decisions had come back to haunt Waah!
Waah staggered to their feet and glanced around for the manure bottle. However, the bottle was nowhere in sight!
Breathing frantically, Waah searched their surroundings and eventually spotted the manure bottle in a tree. Some kind of bug must of put it there!
“Oh no!” Waah wailed. They were hungry, sore and tired. Waah couldn’t bear the thought of climbing a tree at the moment!
The stone tablet appeared in front of Waah, and Waah stumbled a few steps back in surprise. 
“If you answer this math question correctly, I will take your manure down from the tree for you.” It read.
“Okay.” Waah decided.
