Radiant Shrumal Ogre stared at the rock(s) in his hand. 
“No.” He murmured. “NO. YOU WON?! I THOUGHT YOU WERE DUMB! (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻”
Waah stared at him. “Me too!”
“Okay,” the stone tablet chirped in, “Waah won! So, they will become a member of the Council!”
“Yay!!!!111!!!!1” Waah cheered. They followed the stone tablet to a tree. The stone tablet boosted Waah up the tree, and Waah saw a door there!
“Congrats,” the stone tablet read, but Waah hesitated. “But - why? Like, why does a calculator need an obstacle course?”
“¯\_(ツ)_/¯,” the stone tablet read, “probably to make your life harder. Now, go!”
Waah glanced around one last time - the end of the stone path in the distance, Radiant Shrumal Ogre sobbing back down on the ground, the floating stone tablet in front of Waah.
“I can’t wait to do math for the rest of my life!” Waah sighed happily. 
Then they turned back around, opened the door and took a step forward.
