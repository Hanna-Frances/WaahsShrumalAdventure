SUNDAY
Waah woke up and after less than an hour of walking, they saw that the stone path ended!
“Am - am I done?” Waah asked themself.
“Not quite,” a voice said from behind them, and Waah whirled around to see Shroom - the mushroom who had bought from the Manure Shop a week ago!
“What do you mean?” Waah asked, “and what are you doing here?”
“You must defeat the final boss,” Shroom said, “well, if you didn’t fail too many times.”
The stone tablet suddenly appeared out of nowhere, but Waah was used to it by now. 
“Waah did fail 3 or more times,” The tablet read, “so they cannot fight the final boss now, meaning that they are not able to become a Calculator for the Council!”
“NANI??” Waah gasped. “Oh nuuuu!”
“GAME OVER WOMP WOMP” said Radiant Shrumal Ogre
