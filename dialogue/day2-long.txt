TUESDAY
Waah yawned as they woke up, rubbing the sleep out of their eyes. It would be a long day on the Stone Path.
After a few sips of delicious manure, Waah packed up the blanket and the manure and considered taking out the map. 
“Bah, I’m just following the path!” Waah muttered, stuffing the map deep into the backpack.
After a few minutes of strolling down the stone path, Waah noticed little shapes on it in the distance. 
Frowning, Waah jogged the rest of the way to the shapes.
“Oh no!” Waah whispered. The rest of the path was covered in logs and rocks. “So this is what Mushy meant by ‘obstacle course’!”
As you might have figured out already, Waah wasn’t a very bright mushroom (even though they were good at math). 
It never came to Waah that it would be easier to just walk through the bushes beside the path.
Waah navigated their way through the obstacles, and in a few hours, they found themself at a gate.
This gate blocked the path, and even more obstacles were surrounding it, preventing Waah from going around it. 
It was as tall as the Court’s palace and was made of hard looking metal!
“How will I get past this?” Waah groaned. All of a sudden, the stone tablet appeared again! 
“If you answer this math question right, I’ll open the gate for you!” It read.
“Sure!” Waah accepted the offer. The question seemed pretty easy.
