FRIDAY
Waah woke up on the ground, face buried deep into the soil. Spitting out dirt, Waah inspected their surroundings.
Waah was in a little clearing beside a flat rock. Trees and bushes surrounded it. 
“Trees?” Waah thought, “there weren’t this many trees near the Path! Where am I?”
“STONE TABLET THINGY!” Waah hollered, remembering the stone tablet that had helped them so much, “HELP!!!!!!”
The stone tablet appeared again! “If you answer this math question correctly, I will show you the way back to the stone path!”
“You sound like an advertisement,” Waah muttered, “but okey.”
