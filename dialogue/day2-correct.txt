Waah quickly said an answer that they had done in their head. 
The stone tablet’s words changed to “correct!” and the gate creaked open!
Waah tried to thank the stone tablet, but it had already disappeared. Waah continued on their way.
Other than the incident at the gate, it was an uneventful day in the obstacle course. 
Waah passed some bushes and logs that they had to climb over, and their feet began to hurt from walking so much. 
Waah wondered why the Court would do a physical test for a Calculator. Maybe they did a lot of running.
Eventually, Waah began to feel sleepy again. So, they spread out their cloth on a soft patch of dirt and fell asleep.
