Waah said the answer that they had come up with, making sure not to move that 
much. “Incorrect!” The stone tablet read, “but I am nice so I will free you anyways!”
“What was that even for?” Waah sighed, but still thanked the stone tablet as the vines drew away from Waah.
“Remember, if you get three questions wrong…” The stone tablet started, but Waah was already off into the bushes.
Waah wandered around for a bit, searching for the stone path. 
They remembered that they had a compass, but Waah didn’t know how to use a compass! Like, who does?
Eventually, Waah decided to take a little break on a rock. Before Waah knew it, they were asleep.
