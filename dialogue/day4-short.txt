THURSDAY
After a quick breakfast, Waah continued their journey on the stone path.
After a few hours of stumbling over logs and rocks, Waah spotted a clump of bright blue lights in the distance!
Waah sprinted off of the path to look at the lights, and gasped as they saw that they were blue fireflies! 
In Mushroom culture, touching blue fireflies gave you good luck!
Waah leaped up to try to touch one, but the clump moved away. 
Waah followed the fireflies but then stopped as they realized that they were lost! Waah couldnâ€™t see the path anymore!
