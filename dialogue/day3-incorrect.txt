After several seconds of thinking, Waah stated their answer. 
“Incorrect!” The stone tablet read, “I will still get the manure for you, but remember! You could only get three questions wrong before you are disqualified!”
But Waah didn’t hear the last part. They were too busy chugging down some manure.
The stone tablet disappeared again. Waah wondered what it was as they continued down the stone path.
They climbed over logs and rocks that were placed on the path, and it was even worse now that Waah was aching all over!
Like the previous two nights - once Waah felt that they could not go on any longer, they found a soft patch of ground on the edge of the path, spread out their blanket and fell asleep.
