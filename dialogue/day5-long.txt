FRIDAY
Waah woke up with their face buried into the ground. Spitting out dirt, Waah sat up and glanced around.
They were in a small clearing, and Waah was sitting beside a flat rock. Waah remembered falling asleep on it earlier.
Trees and bushes surrounded the clearing, but there were more trees than there were near the path!
Waah rummaged around in their backpack for the map. However, they were not sure where they were on it. 
Suppressing the urge to cry, Waah called out:
“STONE TABLET THINGY! HELP!!!!!!”
The stone tablet appeared again! This time, Waah was not surprised. 
“If you answer this math question correctly, I will show you the way back to the stone path!” It read.
“You sound like an advertisement,” Waah muttered, “but okey.”
